//! Cross-VM resource accounting for the N-API (`imports`) provider.
//!
//! An edgejs guest running under the `imports` provider splits execution and
//! allocation across two VMs: the wasmer store (guest wasm linear memory) and
//! host-native V8. To keep an embedder-imposed memory budget honest across
//! *both*, every pool charges against one shared [`ResourceBudget`] per app.
//!
//! This module implements **Phase 1** of that design: the accountant itself
//! plus exact, deterministic charging of **guest wasm linear memory**. Later
//! phases charge the V8 heap, external memory, and host transients against the
//! same budget, and add CPU metering; the [`Pool`] enum and the budget API are
//! the insertion points for them.
//!
//! ## Install path
//!
//! The guest's linear memory is *imported* (host-created). wasmer's public API
//! does not let an embedder inject a custom [`LinearMemory`] into a
//! [`wasmer::Memory`] directly (the backend `VMMemory` enum is private), so the
//! charge is installed one level down, via custom [`Tunables`]: a
//! [`BudgetedTunables`] wraps [`BaseTunables`] and returns every host memory
//! wrapped in a [`BudgetedMemory`]. Installing those tunables on the engine
//! (see `cli.rs`) makes `Memory::new` — and therefore the guest's imported
//! memory — budget-aware with no change to the memory-creation call site.
